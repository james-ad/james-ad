          Hi! My name is James, and I'm a Web Developer from Seattle, WA. I do
          my work utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm just getting going
          and am learning more each day. I've built a few apps, and this is my
          first site. I built this site from scratch using CSS Grid and Flexbox
          for layout. All of the responsiveness was done using CSS. This process
          taught me how to rearrange and resize page elements at different
          breakpoints to provide the best experience at varying screen sizes. In
          addition to the Holy Trinity of Web Development, I also work with
          React and Node.js. Scroll down to see some of my work, contact info,
          and links.

          <br /><br />
          Outside of coding, I play guitar pretty much daily and I train boxing.
          I like going camping and hiking throughout the Summer. When I'm not
          doing any of that stuff, I'm usually with friends or family. Feel free
          to ask me anything I may have left out.

            <p class="portfolio-section-paragraph">
              This wasn't the first project I built, but it is the first one I
              put a lot of work into. I made it using HTML, CSS, and plain ol'
              Vanilla JS. I wanted to make a program that made it easier to
              figure out how to calculate different percentages of my checks to
              put into savings. What I learned more than anything from this is
              the importance of using CSS styling changes to help deliver a
              better user experience. Inverting the colors on the buttons when
              the user interacts with it, and experimenting with
              linear-gradients instead of solid colors are the things that stand
              out most in my head.

            <p class="portfolio-section-paragraph">
              This project is still a work in progress, but it's far enough
              along to merit displaying its base functionality. I built it using
              HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript, but I plan on building it over
              again using React. I wanted to build a to-do list app that looked
              like a demo on the webpage itself. I kind of liked the idea of
              showing someone how it will look on their phone from a desktop.
              I'm not sure if I'll continue this trend if I choose to rebuild
              this program.

              This is the rebuilt version of my savings calculator. Once I
              finished the base functionality in the first version of this app
              using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, I decided to rebuild it
              using React. I learned about the fundamentals of React while
              building this site, including passing data between components,
              state management, and dynamic rendering of components.
